							<h1 class="major">Self Evaluation</h1>
							<p>I am an absolute dumb sh*t c*nt.</p>
							<p>I don't normally feel this in my day-to-day life, since I am definitely short-eyed and I cannot see either the history and learn from it, or the future and try to plan for it. What is more pathetic, I can sometimes consider myself so good, being satisfied and become afraid of admitting I am actually low-end, I do not want to stay with the people and things that are "not that good" per se, because I want to be friends and involved with elites so I can learn and get better since environment somehow matters, but it never worked out, now I am just bad at everything and have no one around. I did manage to graduate from University of Sydney, but I am actually worse and more stupid comparing to junior high students today.</p>
							<p>When I was very young, like in kindergarten, I was always the most messy and uncultured f*ck without manner. Chinese kindergarten forces students to take nap, I was never able to take a full good one without wetting something. I always forgot to bring stuff to school even I tried my hardest, and when I wanted to play with others, people always gave me clown face, it's a sign of children's "Go F*ck Yourself".</p>
							<p>When I was in elementary school, I was catching up my classes, but one thing I always failed was to write readable texts and doing stuff quickly and nice. I remember my mom was really going hard about this on me, but I just cannot do it, I always ended up being miserable and don't know how to do deep inside, I just stood there like a cunt and my mom was always disappointed.</p>
							<p>The first 2 years about my junior high, was actually the best period of me being academic, I literally nailed everything at this stage and managed to position 4th in my class. I got 50/50 in my geography senior high entrance exam and I really tried hard. I was exhausted, then my whole life was just a slope here in junior high and I ended up no high school actually wanted me. I think probably somehow I ended up in one? It was such a disaster and I don't even actually remind this clear.</p>
							<p>Then I planned to study abroad (actually my mom's idea), I firstly planned to study in HKU, but my IELTS and SAT were never expected to fulfill the requirements, and I can NEVER learn Cantonese, so I just went Australia, and University of Sydney took me with Foundation Program. And I failed to apply for any degree that is full 4-year or not the bottom-tier, and if I took these I can (like my 3-year BCST), I needed another half-year of language. Then everything else was not so far away, I can remember how I tried from day to night, overstayed in Fisher once and another then managed to get 40-60 mark. I am actually garbage.</p>
							<p>Today, I am a man who got fired in my internship and can never find another one even. I don't even think there is a way out, I don't know what to do.</p>
