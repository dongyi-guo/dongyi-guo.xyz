            <blockquote>Up to 0.6.1.7</blockquote>
            <p>This page contains all the hackie techniques about every ghost in Phasmophobia, whether obviously told or untold in the journal. Reminder all the information is sourced from Insym, Psycho, CJ and my daily plays, I will keep this always up to date with the newest version but Kinetic Games may change stuff without hinting us. Be aware.</p>

            <h2>Spirit</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>After being smudged, Spirit has 180s of hunting prevention period rather than 90s for general ghosts.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <h2>Wraith</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>After walking on salt, Wraith is not able to leave any footprints.</li>
                <li>Wraith can teleport to any player at any time, doing so will generate EMF2/EMF5 and you can take interaction photos on the exact point, if you find this kind of EMF which literally comes out of nowhere with no interaction around, or the ghost can do interactions, ghost events or start hunts around you even if you are far away from the ghost room, then Wraith is one candidate to suspect.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <h2>Phantom</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Phantom will blink less frequently comparing to other ghosts, making it having a slightly longer invisible interval while hunting. Currently probs 0.5-0.8s per blink comparing to 0.3s per blink for general ghosts.</li>
                <li>While taking photo of a Phantom, they will disappear, but the ghost event/hunt will not be effected by its demanifastation, you should still hear its sounds. Also you will get a ghost photo in journal successfully but there is no ghost in it.</li>
                <li>Phantom can walk up to players at any time ignoring the roaming distance constraint, it's quite like Wraith teleport but Phantom actually needs to walk up to you, and doing so will generate EMF2/EMF5, if you find this kind of EMF which literally comes out of nowhere with no interaction around, or the ghost can do interactions, ghost events or start hunts around you even if you are far away from the ghost room, then Phantom is one candidate to suspect.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <h2>Poltergeist</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Poltergeist can throw multiple objects at once, although doing so will still give EMF2/3, but if Activity Chart is available to you, you can find a HUGE peak of activity value can be up to 10, the activity is added by each item and for each item thrown, all players around this throw will drop 2% sanity.</li>
                <li>Poltergeist can make a strong throw as well.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <h2>Banshee</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Banshee is always obssessed with a player as its obssession.</li>
                <li>Banshee ONLY cares its obssession's sanity and behaves on that.</li>
                <li>Banshee can walk/follow up to their obssession regardless the roaming distance constraint, quite like Phantom walking up.</li>
                <li>Banshee prefers doing singing ghost event.</li>
                <li>Banshee's singing ghost event will drop obssesion's sanity 5% extra.</li>
                <li>If the obssession dies, Banshee will pick up a new obssesion immediately.</li>
                <li>Banshee can make high-pitch hell scream on paramic.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <h2>Jinn</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Jinn's powers only works while breaker is ON, turning it off disables them.</li>
                <li>Jinn cannot turn off breakers.</li>
                <li>Jinn can move faster while targeted player is 2m away while hunting (at approx. 2.3-2.5m/s), after getting close to the player it will slow down to normal hunting speed 1.5m/s and regain normal hunting acceleration. </li>
                <li>If Jinn is 3m close to a player, it can decide to drop 25% of the sanity of all players in this 3m area. Doing so will NOT leave EMF2/5. Be careful.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <h2>Mare</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Mare can start hunting at 60% of sanity if it locates in a room that is light off, but only 40% if in a room that is light on.</li>
                <li>Mare can not turn on lights.</li>
                <li>Mare has a stronger motivation to turn off lights.</li>
                <li>There is a chance that if a player turns on the light in its room, it will immediately switch it off.</li>
                <li>Mare is more likely to do lightbulb explosion ghost event.</li>
                <li>Mare can be super insane once player's sanity is low and while the light is off, and the craziness scales up pretty quickly as sanity goes down. Its hunting cooldown can be significantly lowered and behave like a crazy Demon.</li>
                <li>Mare can be pushed away if certain area has too much lights, it will wander a long way in order to find a dark place.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <h2>Revenant</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>While spotting a player in hunt, Revenant can zoom-zoom at 3m/s rushing to the player.</li>
                <li>Once Revenant has no player on sight, it can only travel at 0.8-1m/s.</li>
                <li>Revenant will lose speed boost and slow down once LOS is cut, but smudging a Revenant will NOT slow down until the 5s smudging period is over, and there is no player on sight.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <h2>Shade</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Shade has 0% chance of doing ghost event while sanity is at 100%.</li>
                <li>For each 1% sanity loss, shade gain 2% more chance of doing ghost event, capped at 100%, means Shade will do ghost event like any other ghosts.</li>
                <li>Shade can only start hunting from 35% sanity level, instead of 50% for general ghosts.</li>
                <li>Shade prefers more on hissing, airball and shadow-manifasting ghost events.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <br>

            <h2>Demon</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Demon can start hunting regularly from 70% of sanity, instead of 50% for general ghosts.</li>
                <li>Demon can rarely hunt completely regardless the sanity. (from 100%)</li>
                <li>After being smudged, Demon only has 60s of hunting prevention period instead of 90s for general ghosts.</li>
                <li>Demon often has a much lower hunts cooldown, with minimial of 20s to start another hunt, instead of 25s for general ghosts. You should expect chain-hunting from a Demon.</li>
                <li>Crucifix affects Demon in a 5m range instead of 3m for general ghosts.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <h2>Yurei</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Yurei can activate its power to drain 13% of sanity of all players in 8m range, doing so will make one door fully closed without any interaction, for this door close the closing sound will be delayed after the animation of closing.</li>
                <li>Yurei will be more constrainted in the room where it is smudged for the duration of smudge.</li>
                <li>If comparing Yurei to other ghosts, Yurei would be expected to be a bit shy.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <h2>Oni</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Oni is mega-cracked, loving doing ghost events back to back, and even more insane while multiple people are around.</li>
                <li>Oni can throw objects at really high speed and really far, making it a strong giga yeet.</li>
                <li>Oni cannot do airball and shadow-manifesting ghost event.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <h2>Yokai</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Yokai can be angered by player's talking, if a player is talking near a Yokai, it can start a hunt at 80% of sanity right on top of the noisy person.</li>
                <li>Yokai has a really limited range of sensoring player's voice and electronic devices while hunting. (2m range instead of 8m for general ghosts).</li>
                <li>Yokai is also more active if player is noisy and talktive, and really passive if player is quite.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <br>

            <h2>Hantu</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Hantu always has Freezing as an evidence in Nightmare.</li>
                <li>Hantu cannot turn on breaker.</li>
                <li>Hantu has double the chance to turn off the breaker.</li>
                <li>Hantu does not have regular acceleration while chasing in hunts.</li>
                <li>Instead, Hantu's speed is heavily tied to the room temperature that it is located in.</li>
                <li>1.4m/s while > 15C</li>
                <li>1.5m/s while < 15C</li>
                <li>1.75m/s while <= 12C</li>
                <li>2.1m/s while <= 9C</li>
                <li>2.3m/s while <= 6C</li>
                <li>2.5m/s while <= 3C</li>
                <li>2.7m/s while <= 0C</li>
                <li>Note: Player's walking speed is 1.6m/s and sprinting is 3-3.2m/s.</li>    
            </ul>

            <br>

            <h2>Goryo</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Goryo always has Dots as an evidence in Nightmare.</li>
                <li>Goryo's Dots cannot be seen with naked eyes, and can only be seen via night vision electronics while no one is in Goryo's room, otherwise it won't do it.</li>
                <li>Goryo is less likely to change it's favorite room and it's wandering chance and  distance is also limited and shorter.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <h2>Myling</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Myling seems more likely to have quiter vocal sounds in hunts.</li>
                <li>The true Quiteness of Myling is the footstep sounds: If you are at same floor of a Myling with electronics on, you cannot hear any footsteps before your electronics are jammed.</li>
                <li>Myling probs responses little more on the paramic, but very unreliable.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <h2>Onryo</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Onryo starts the game with 3 tokens, every time it blows a fire source out, it consumes one token. Fire sources so far are Candles, Lighters and Campfire.</li>
                <li>If all tokens are consumed, next time Onryo blows out a fire, it will have 50% of the chance to initiate a hunt regardless the sanity (used to be 80-85%, whether which one is intentional or bugged is unknown).</li>
                <li>Everytime a player dies, Onryo's fire-put-out hunt chance are increased by 25%.</li>
                <li>Everytime Onryo manages to clean out all lighted fire sources, Onryo's fire-put-out hunt chance are increased by 10%.</li>
                <li>Onryo cannot start a hunt if multiple fire sources are presented and lighted. This makes light sources work quite like Crucifix. You can combine Candle and Crucifix to rule out Onryo as a option if Crucifix is used before light sources are put out, since Candle has even larger range than Crucifix. (4m comparing to 3ms) </li>
                <li>Onryo has ability to put out multiple fire sources at literally the same time.</li>
                <li>Onryo also put out fire sources really quickly.</li>
                <li>Onryo can be pushed out if too many fire sources are gathered in a certain area, it will wander away in order to find a fire-less area.</li>
                <li>If fire sources have been presented to Onryo, it has 60% of sanity as normal hunting constraints instead of 50% for general ghosts and itself if no fire was ever presented.</li> 
            </ul>

            <br>

            <h2>The Twins</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Except the original ghost, there is a decoy playing as the role of the twin.</li>
                <li>The original ghost can give all 3 evidences, but decoy can only give EMF5 via interaction.</li>
                <li>The Twins always do stuff back to back, if Activity Chart is available, there will be a double tower pattern with edges nearly combined like a slope, indicating a "twinteraction".</li>
                <li>While hunting, the decoy moves 110% fast of normal ghost movement while the original moves 90%.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <h2>Raiju</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>While electronic devices are on and nearly, Raiju can gain power from them and makes it travel faster in hunting. (up to 2.65m/s)</li>
                <li>Raiju has a larger range of impacting the electronic devices. (10m range instead of 8m for general ghosts)</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <h2>Obake</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Obake always has Fingerprints as an evidence in Nightmare.</li>
                <li>Obake can sometimes not leave a Fingerprints, while all other Fingerprint Ghosts always leaves Fingerprints. (75% instead of 100%)</li>
                <li>Obake can sometimes leave special six-finger Fingerprints on doors, windows, closets, lockers, and maybe coolboxes. For cell doors and keyboards, it will present 5 fingers instead of 4 for general ghosts. For light switches there will be fingerprints way longer than the switch itself instead of a little nub for general ghosts. All Obake special fingerprints have fingers looks like a eagle's foot. </li>
                <li>Obake can activate its power to make the fingerprints it left half the time it preserves.</li>
                <li>Obake's interaction EMF goes away a little bit faster, or sometimes doesn't even there. (Could be bugged)</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <h2>The Mimic</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>If you have Ghost Orb, Spirit Box and Fingerprints, it is a Mimic as well.</li>
                <li>The Mimic is the only ghost presenting 3 evidences in Nightmare, one of them is fake Orb.</li>
                <li>The Mimic has a minimial time of one minute to switch its mimicing targets.</li>
                <li>The Mimic can mimic itself, making it a plain ghost.</li>
                <li>The Mimic can mimic the player, making it doing literally nothing.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Happy Ghost Hunting ;-)</p>
