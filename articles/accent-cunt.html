							<h1 class="major">What accent did I just do?</h1>
							<p>It may come to be sensible that if you know a language really well, whether it is your mother tongue, accents can trouble you when you first hear them, but it couldn't be that much of trouble for you to try to catch it up, or maybe sometimes you can just enjoy using them in your daily drive consciously or not. However, this is never the case for me, and the story starts from my very young age.</p>
							<p>I was able to speak at very late age, approximately 2 years old and plus, this made my family really concerned if there was anything wrong of me. Lots of doctors have been visited, and I was finally able to speak words like nearly 3. I was raised in BoShan, Zibo, Shandong Province, China while I was young, there is such a strong accent here that differs a lot from any other accents around us and of course the Mandarin as well, even living in an environment like this, my small tiny little shitty head still never hooked up to be able to understand the phrase properly in this accent. Every time my grandma and pa needed to talk to me, they will switch to Mandarin, so I can understand better. And yes, I have the best grandma and grandpa on this planet, I couldn't be more regretted that I didn't treat them better as I should be because some shenanigans happened in my life.</p>
							<p>There are countless time that people talking in BoShan-ese to me that I cannot understand them, thus misunderstand them and make misbehaves and mistreats. What's more, even for those north accents in Zibo, or other accents from the west and the east, I ain't understand shit, they are even more confusing and since the speaker is definitely not my family, they will raise their voice and get anger, making me the little pussy even harder to understand any shit it is speaking. </p>
							<p>When I stepped into university, even it is an Australian one, I was able to get to know way more Chinese from different places ever possible. I sometimes glimpse shows made in different part of China, and I found the differences on cultures and accents are simply HUGE. There are some accents I can never learn, like Shanghainese or Cantonese. I spent a full year in Shanghai, with people speak Shanghainese around me, and I caught to learn no shit from them. Also, I learned Cantonese for like half a year, since before University of Sydney, I planned to go to HKU, but I know nothing about Cantonese like at all! For other accents, like Peking-ese, Sichuan-ese and ManZhou-ese, I was able to mimic the ways it's talking in Mandarin, but I was never able to speak in it and understand any legit phrases from it. When I lived in Merrylands in Australia, my roommate is from Shenyang, he speaks the most standard Shenyang-ese and because I am trying to catch his way of speaking, he also attempted to communicate with me using the standard Shenyang-ese, and I was like I can only understand 30% of them. I am absolutely trash.</p>
							<p>This also applies to the other language that I can kinda communicate in, no surprise, the English. I was actually firstly raised in African English since my teacher is from Africa, then I am not quite improving during Chinese standard English class, until I met my IELTS teacher, Tim Wood, who is from Southampton. I also mainly learn English from watching Apple's WWDC and all the product release keynotes, TV shows from US or UK, and YouTube videos. After all of these, what I can do is now I can copy the way that those people I watched to talk, so I can somehow express my shitty ideas in my shitty head, this means sometimes I jump from one accent to another pretty regularly, and I don't know how to make them consistent. How stupid of me.</p>
